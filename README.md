# Community-Detection

In this project, "Community Detection from Research Articles", the task then becomes detecting research papers which belong to a common field of research.
The project contains following folders:
> aan :
This folder consists of the AAN (ACL Anthology Network) dataset. We worked on the 2013 release of the dataset.

> aan_small :
This folder consists of the subset of the AAN dataset. It consists of ~2000 nodes.

> algorithms:
This folder contains code for the different algorithms used.
cosine-kmeans
jaccard-kmeans
louvain
newman-girvan
newman-girvan-v2 (using lib)

> metrics:
This folder contains code for the community detection using different metrics.
>> authorCitation: This metric uses the author citation network to detect communities. We have used louvain and newman-girvan algorithms for this.
How to run: Refer Community-Detection/metrics/authorCitation/README.md
>> paperCitaion: This metric uses the paper citation network to detect communities. We have used louvain and newman-girvan algorithms for this.
How to run: Refer Community-Detection/metrics/paperCitation/README.md
>> title: This folder contains the code for running K-means algorithm (using Jaccard and Cosine) on the title metric.
How to run: Refer title/README.md
>> year: This folder contains the code for running K-means algorithm (using Jaccard and Cosine) on the year metric.
How to run: Refer year/README.md

> outputs :
This folder contains the outputs from various algorithms along with their respective graphs.

> cleanup.sh: used to remove any *.pyc files from project.

> CommunityDetectionReport.pdf: This is the project report
