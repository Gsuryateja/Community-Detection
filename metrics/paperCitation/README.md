# Run

To create the graph:

> python createGraph.py w/uw

To run the newman-girvan algorithm:
> python newman-girvan.py w/uw

To run the louvain algorithm:
> python louvain.py w/uw

Note: Before running any of the algorithms, the graph must be constructed first. The 'uw' in the above commands refers to the use/construction of an `unweighted graph`, whereas a 'w' refers to a `weighted graph`.
